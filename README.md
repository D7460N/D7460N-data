# D7460N Data Repository

This repository contains multiple independent datasets for use with the D7460N UI framework.

Each dataset is fully separated from UI logic, demonstrating strict separation of concerns between presentation (UI) and content (data).

## Structure

- `datasets.json` — Master list of all available datasets
- `/DHCP/` — DHCP Option Types and related network data
- `/ID/` — International Dance students, events, and related data
- (More datasets can be added as needed)

## Purpose

This repository serves as the flexible, centralized data backend for all D7460N demos, proving that a single static UI can dynamically adapt to multiple data structures without requiring changes to the UI code.
